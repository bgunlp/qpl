# QPL Parser

This module contains Scala code for an incremental parser in the spirit of [PICARD](https://github.com/ServiceNow/picard),
only instead of parsing raw SQL, it parses QPL.

The QPL Parser can parse QPL strings token by token in an incremental manner, as required by the PICARD constrained decoding method.
It takes into account the following constraints when decoding a candidate token:
- Syntax of QPL
- Types of schema columns when parsing comparisons such as `column op value` - as in `weight > 3000`
- The existence of foreign key constraints when parsing join predicates as in `#3 Join [ #1 , #2 ] Predicate [ #1.id = #2.student_idÂ ]`

The parser exposes the following REST endpoints:

- `/tokenizer` for registering a tokenizer with the parser. The parser will use the registered tokenizer to convert from token IDs to strings.
- `/schema` for registering a schema with the parser.
- `/parse` for incrementally parsing either a partial or full QPL string.
- `/validate` for validating whether a QPL string is valid.
- `/docs` for a Swagger documentation page where you can try out requests.

## Prerequisites

If not using the Docker image, all you need is Scala-CLI which can be downloaded from [here](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/).
It will take care of downloading suitable Java Development Kit and Scala versions.

## Libraries in Use

- [atto](https://tpolecat.github.io/atto/) - An incremental parser based on Haskell's [attoparsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec)
- [tapir](https://github.com/softwaremill/tapir) - For creating a typed API easily
- [ZIO](https://zio.dev/) - For handling concurrency in the API

## How to Use

### The Easiest Option

Use the pre-packaged Docker image by running: `docker run -p 8081:8081 beneyal/qpl-parser-scala:latest`

### The Easy Option

Open a terminal in the directory where this `README.md` is placed, and run `scala-cli run .`

## Interesting Files

The file `parse.scala` contains all the code for parsing QPL, along with the semantic checks performed during parsing
such as type-checking, key relationships, etc.

The file `Endpoints.scala` is where the server logic lies, which knows how to take a request
that consists of input IDs (that came from a HuggingFace tokenizer), parse it, and return the partial parse
back to the client.

## Troubleshooting

- If an error is thrown by PICARD when registering a tokenizer, do the following:
    1. Download [OpenSSL 1.1.1w](https://www.openssl.org/source/)
    2. Extract the file using `tar -xzvf openssl-1.1.1w.tar.gz`
    3. Go into the newly created directory
    4. Run `./config`
    5. Run `make`
    6. Run PICARD using `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/openssl-1.1.1w scala-cli run .`
